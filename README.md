## [Experiments](/experiments/experiments.json)

## Results
I was not able to cultivate Morel Mushrooms successfully. 

## Germinating Apple Seeds
As part of these experiments I germinated a large number of Antonovka Apple seeds. I found the best method for doing this is to 

1. Purchase Antonovka Apple seeds from  My Seeds. Co (https://www.myseeds.co/)
2. Soak the seeds overnight
3. Place the seeds on a damp paper towel in a plastic bag
4. Refrigerate at 7â„ƒ for 1-2 months
5. Plant in potting soil
