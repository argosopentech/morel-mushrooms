# Experiments

I'm researching Morel Mushroom cultivation. I'm currently working on germinating tree seeds, and my basic thesis is that you have to grow the Morels symbiotically with live trees. I'm going to try growing trees hydroponically, grow Morels in their root system, then burn the trees to simulate a forest fire. I'm also trying to setup a software system for effectively tracking experiments and observations.

I also have access to a natural Morel patch in Central IL and may experiment with expanding it or collecting wild Morel strains.

Contributions are welcome and I can accept pull requests to; expand the wiki, add new experiment data, or anything else related to Morels.
