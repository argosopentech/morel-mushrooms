# Experiments

I'm working on trying to cultivate them but am currently in a exploratory phase. I'm working on germinating tree seeds, and my basic thesis is that you have to grow the Morels symbiotically with live trees. I'm going to try growing trees hydroponically, grow Morels in their root system, then burn the trees to simulate a forest fire. I'm also trying to setup a software system for tracking experiments and observations.

Contributions are welcome and I can accept pull requests to; expand the wiki, add new experiment data, or anything related to Morels.
